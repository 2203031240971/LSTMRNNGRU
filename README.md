# LSTMRNNGRU
🚀 Project Completed: Next Word Prediction using LSTM (Deep Learning)

I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully built and deployed a Next Word Prediction system using LSTM as part of my deep learning practice.

🔍 Project Highlights:

Implemented an LSTM-based language model for next-word prediction

Used TensorFlow & Keras for model development

Applied tokenization and sequence padding for NLP preprocessing

Built an interactive Streamlit web app for real-time predictions

Ensured clean environment setup and model persistence (.h5, tokenizer)

🛠️ Tech Stack:

 Python | TensorFlow / Keras | NumPy | NLP | LSTM | Streamlit

📈 Key Learnings:

Handling sequence data in NLP

Managing model–tokenizer consistency

Debugging real-world environment & dependency issues

Deploying ML models as user-friendly applications

This project strengthened my understanding of RNNs, LSTMs, and end-to-end ML workflows.

 Looking forward to building more projects with GRU, Transformers, and Generative AI 🚀

🔗 Open to feedback, suggestions, and collaboration!
